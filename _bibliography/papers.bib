      abstract={We study the quantum critical point between the fermionic $\nu=8$ quantum Hall state and the bosonic $\nu=2$ quantum Hall state of Cooper pairs. Our study is motivated by the composite fermion construction for the daughter states of even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states and the experimentally observed transition between the daughter and the Jain states at the same filling. We show that this transition is equivalent to the transition between a neutral invertible $E_8$ state and a topologically trivial state. These transitions can be described in a partonic framework as a cascade of mass changes of four neutral Dirac fermions coupled to multiple Abelian Chern-Simons $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the absence of fine-tuning, the transition is split into a series of four or more different transitions, with at least three distinct intermediate topologically ordered phases hosting neutral anyons. },

However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai/},

  abstract = {Fractional quantum Hall states at a half-filled Landau level are believed to carry an integer number C of chiral Majorana edge modes, reflected in their thermal Hall conductivity. We show that this number determines the primary series of Abelian fractional quantum Hall states that emerge above and below the half-filling point. On a particular side of half-filling each series may originate from two consecutive values of C, but the combination of the series above and below half-filling uniquely identifies C. We analyze these states both by a hierarchy approach and by a composite fermion approach. In the latter, we map electrons near a half-filled Landau level to composite fermions at a weak magnetic field and show that a bosonic integer quantum Hall state is formed by pairs of composite fermions and plays a crucial role in the state's Hall conductivity.},

  abstract = {The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), we build The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive. Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x larger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. We find that our small model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model, StarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its size. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code completion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource languages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.},

Unlike current leading methods, which filter pixels with low-confidence predictions in isolation, our approach leverages the spatial correlation of labels in segmentation maps by grouping neighboring pixels and considering their pseudo-labels collectively. With this contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the pseudo-labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For example, S4MC achieves a 1.29 mIoU improvement over the prior state-of-the-art method on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at this https URL},

  abstract = {The BigCode community, an open-scientific collaboration working on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), introduces StarCoder and StarCoderBase: 15.5B parameter models with 8K context length, infilling capabilities and fast large-batch inference enabled by multi-query attention. StarCoderBase is trained on 1 trillion tokens sourced from The Stack, a large collection of permissively licensed GitHub repositories with inspection tools and an opt-out process. We fine-tuned StarCoderBase on 35B Python tokens, resulting in the creation of StarCoder. We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of Code LLMs to date and show that StarCoderBase outperforms every open Code LLM that supports multiple programming languages and matches or outperforms the OpenAI code-cushman-001 model. Furthermore, StarCoder outperforms every model that is fine-tuned on Python, can be prompted to achieve 40\% pass@1 on HumanEval, and still retains its performance on other programming languages. We take several important steps towards a safe open-access model release, including an improved PII redaction pipeline and a novel attribution tracing tool, and make the StarCoder models publicly available under a more commercially viable version of the Open Responsible AI Model license.},

  abstract = {Autonomous scene exposure and exploration, especially in localization or communication-denied areas, useful for finding targets in unknown scenes, remains a challenging problem in computer navigation. In this work, we present a novel method for real-time environment exploration, whose only requirements are a visually similar dataset for pre-training, enough lighting in the scene, and an on-board forward-looking RGB camera for environmental sensing. As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest amount of currently unexplored areas. Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is able to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more complicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited. In addition, we propose a way to generate a navigation-oriented dataset, enabling efficient training of our method using RGB and depth images. Tests conducted in a simulator evaluating both the sparse pixels'coordinations inferring process, and 2D and 3D test flights aimed to unveil areas and decrease distances to targets achieve promising results. Comparison against a state-of-the-art algorithm shows our method is able to overperform it, that while measuring the new voxels per camera pose, minimum distance to target, percentage of surface voxels seen, and compute time metrics.},

  abstract = {Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG- bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood develop- ment, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google- internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.},

Understanding and solving such problems require developing analytic tools and techniques. In this work, we propose the notion of recoverability, which is tightly related to information aggregation in GNNs, and based on this concept, develop the method for GNN embedding analysis. We define recoverability theoretically and propose a method for its efficient empirical estimation. We demonstrate, through extensive experimental results on various datasets and different GNN architectures, that estimated recoverability correlates with aggregation method expressivity and graph sparsification quality. Therefore, we believe that the proposed method could provide an essential tool for understanding the roots of the aforementioned problems, and potentially lead to a GNN design that overcomes them.

  abstract = {The referring video object segmentation task (RVOS) involves segmentation of a text-referred object instance in the frames of a given video. Due to the complex nature of this multimodal task, which combines text reasoning, video understanding, instance segmentation and tracking, existing approaches typically rely on sophisticated pipelines in order to tackle it. In this paper, we propose a simple Transformer-based approach to RVOS. Our framework, termed Multimodal Tracking Transformer (MTTR), models the RVOS task as a sequence prediction problem. Following recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, MTTR is based on the realization that video and text can both be processed together effectively and elegantly by a single multimodal Transformer model. MTTR is end-to-end trainable, free of text-related inductive bias components and requires no additional mask-refinement post-processing steps. As such, it simplifies the RVOS pipeline considerably compared to existing methods. Evaluation on standard benchmarks reveals that MTTR significantly outperforms previous art across multiple metrics. In particular, MTTR shows impressive +5.7 and +5.0 mAP gains on the A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets respectively, while processing 76 frames per second. In addition, we report strong results on the public validation set of Refer-YouTube-VOS, a more challenging RVOS dataset that has yet to receive the attention of researchers.

In this paper, we identify a "warm-up obstacle": the inability of standard warm-up stages to train high quality feature extractors and avert memorization of noisy labels. We propose "Contrast to Divide" (C2D), a simple framework that solves this problem by pre-training the feature extractor in a self-supervised fashion. Using self-supervised pre-training boosts the performance of existing LNL approaches by drastically reducing the warm-up stage's susceptibility to noise level, shortening its duration, and increasing extracted feature quality. C2D works out of the box with existing methods and demonstrates markedly improved performance, especially in the high noise regime, where we get a boost of more than 27\% for CIFAR-100 with 90\% noise over the previous state of the art. In real-life noise settings, C2D trained on mini-WebVision outperforms previous works both in WebVision and ImageNet validation sets by 3\% top-1 accuracy. We perform an in-depth analysis of the framework, including investigating the performance of different pre-training approaches and estimating the effective upper bound of the LNL performance with semi-supervised learning.

To tackle this problem, we propose training a neural network with discrete features in the last layer, followed by two heads: a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) and a decision tree. The decision tree utilizes simple binary decision stumps, thus encouraging features to have semantic meaning. We present a theoretical analysis, as well as a practical method for learning in the intersection of two hypothesis classes. Compared with various benchmarks, our results show an improved ability to extract a set of features highly correlated with a ground truth set of unseen attributes.},

These domains, e.g., social networks and product recommendations, are fertile ground for malicious users and behavior. In this paper, we show that GNNs are vulnerable to the extremely limited (and thus quite realistic) scenarios of a single-node adversarial attack, where the perturbed node cannot be chosen by the attacker. That is, an attacker can force the GNN to classify any target node to a chosen label, by only slightly perturbing the features or the neighbors list of another single arbitrary node in the graph, even when not being able to select that specific attacker node. When the adversary is allowed to select the attacker node, these attacks are even more effective. We demonstrate empirically that our attack is effective across various common GNN types (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN) and robustly optimized GNNs (e.g., Robust GCN, SM GCN, GAL, LAT-GCN), outperforming previous attacks across different real-world datasets both in a targeted and non-targeted attacks.

Self-supervised deep learning has become a strong instrument for representation learning in computer vision. However, those methods have not been evaluated in a fully unsupervised setting. In this paper, we propose a simple scheme for unsupervised classification based on self-supervised representations. We evaluate the proposed approach with several recent self-supervised methods showing that it achieves competitive results for ImageNet classification (39\% accuracy on ImageNet with 1000 clusters and 46\% with overclustering). We suggest adding the unsupervised evaluation to a set of standard benchmarks for self-supervised learning. The code is available at this https URL},

  abstract = {The demand for running NNs in embedded environments has increased significantly in recent years due to the significant success of convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches in various tasks, including image recognition and generation. The task of achieving high accuracy on resource-restricted devices, however, is still considered to be challenging, which is mainly due to the vast number of design parameters that need to be balanced. While the quantization of CNN parameters leads to a reduction of power and area, it can also generate unexpected changes in the balance between communication and computation. This change is hard to evaluate, and the lack of balance may lead to lower utilization of either memory bandwidth or computational resources, thereby reducing performance. This paper introduces a hardware performance analysis framework for identifying bottlenecks in the early stages of CNN hardware design. We demonstrate how the proposed method can help in evaluating different architecture alternatives of resource-restricted CNN accelerators (e.g., part of real-time embedded systems) early in design stages and, thus, prevent making design mistakes.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to malicious perturbations. Current methods for improving adversarial robustness make use of either implicit or explicit regularization, with the latter is usually based on adversarial training. Randomized smoothing, the averaging of the classifier outputs over a random distribution centered in the sample, has been shown to guarantee a classifier’s performance subject to bounded perturbations of the input. In this work, we study the application of randomized smoothing to improve performance on unperturbed data and increase robustness to adversarial attacks. We propose to combine smoothing along with adversarial training and randomization approaches, and find that doing so significantly improves the resilience compared to the baseline. We examine our method’s performance on common white-box (FGSM, PGD) and black-box (transferable attack and NAttack) attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and determine that for a low number of iterations, smoothing provides a significant performance boost that persists even for perturbations with a high attack norm, e. For example, under a PGD-10 attack on CIFAR-10 using Wide-ResNet28-4, we achieve 60.3\% accuracy for infinity norm e∞=8/255 and 13.1\% accuracy for e∞=35/255 – outperforming previous art by 3\% and 6\%, respectively. We achieve nearly twice the accuracy on e∞=35/255 and even more so for perturbations with higher infinity norm. A reference implementation of the proposed method is provided.},

Current post-training quantization methods fall short in terms of accuracy for INT4 (or lower) but provide reasonable accuracy for INT8 (or above). In this work, we study the effect of quantization on the structure of the loss landscape. We show that the structure is flat and separable for mild quantization, enabling straightforward post-training quantization methods to achieve good results. We show that with more aggressive quantization, the loss landscape becomes highly non-separable with steep curvature, making the selection of quantization parameters more challenging. Armed with this understanding, we design a method that quantizes the layer parameters jointly, enabling significant accuracy improvement over current post-training quantization methods.

  abstract = {One major obstacle hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference is their relatively high memory bandwidth requirements, which can be the primary energy consumer and throughput bottleneck in hardware accelerators. Inspired by quantization-aware training approaches, we propose a compression-aware training (CAT) method that involves training the model to allow better compression of weights and feature maps during neural network deployment. Our method trains the model to achieve low-entropy feature maps, enabling efficient compression at inference time using classical transform coding methods. CAT significantly improves the state-of-the-art results reported for quantization evaluated on various vision and NLP tasks, such as image classification (ImageNet), image detection (Pascal VOC), sentiment analysis (CoLa), and textual entailment (MNLI). For example, on ResNet-18, we achieve near baseline ImageNet accuracy with an average representation of only 1.5 bits per value with 5-bit quantization. Moreover, we show that entropy reduction of weights and activations can be applied together, further improving bandwidth reduction. Reference implementation is available.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of tasks in computer vision and beyond. One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference on low-power edge devices is their high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. The latter often dominates the energy footprint on modern hardware. In this paper, we introduce a lossy transform coding approach, inspired by image and video compression, designed to reduce the memory bandwidth due to the storage of intermediate activation calculation results. Our method does not require fine-tuning the network weights and halves the data transfer volumes to the main memory by compressing feature maps, which are highly correlated, with variable length coding. Our method outperform previous approach in term of the number of bits per value with minor accuracy degradation on ResNet-34 and MobileNetV2. We analyze the performance of our approach on a variety of CNN architectures and demonstrate that FPGA implementation of ResNet-18 with our approach results in a reduction of around 40\% in the memory energy footprint, compared to quantized network, with negligible impact on accuracy. When allowing accuracy degradation of up to 2\%, the reduction of 60\% is achieved. A reference implementation accompanies the paper.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning has become a de facto standard in machine learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrating spectacular success on a wide variety of tasks. However, CNNs are typically very demanding computationally at inference time. One of the ways to alleviate this burden on certain hardware platforms is quantization relying on the use of low-precision arithmetic representation for the weights and the activations. Another popular method is the pruning of the number of filters in each layer. While mainstream deep learning methods train the neural networks weights while keeping the network architecture fixed, the emerging neural architecture search (NAS) techniques make the latter also amenable to training. In this paper, we formulate optimal arithmetic bit length allocation and neural network pruning as a NAS problem, searching for the configurations satisfying a computational complexity budget while maximizing the accuracy. We use a differentiable search method based on the continuous relaxation of the search space proposed by Liu et al. (arXiv:1806.09055). We show, by grid search, that heterogeneous quantized networks suffer from a high variance which renders the benefit of the search questionable. For pruning, improvement over homogeneous cases is possible, but it is still challenging to find those configurations with the proposed method.

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are very popular in many fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Though deep learning leads to groundbreaking performance in those domains, the networks used are very computationally demanding and are far from being able to perform in real-time applications even on a GPU, which is not power efficient and therefore does not suit low power systems such as mobile devices. To overcome this challenge, some solutions have been proposed for quantizing the weights and activations of these networks, which accelerate the runtime significantly. Yet, this acceleration comes at the cost of a larger error unless spatial adjustments are carried out. The method proposed in this work trains quantized neural networks by noise injection and a learned clamping, which improve accuracy. This leads to state-of-the-art results on various regression and classification tasks, e.g., ImageNet classification with architectures such as ResNet-18/34/50 with as low as 3 bit weights and activations. We implement the proposed solution on an FPGA to demonstrate its applicability for low-power real-time applications. The quantization code will become publicly available upon acceptance.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method for neural network quantization. Our method, named UNIQ, emulates a non-uniform k-quantile quantizer and adapts the model to perform well with quantized weights by injecting noise to the weights at training time. As a by-product of injecting noise to weights, we find that activations can also be quantized to as low as 8-bit with only a minor accuracy degradation. Our non-uniform quantization approach provides a novel alternative to the existing uniform quantization techniques for neural networks. We further propose a novel complexity metric of number of bit operations performed (BOPs), and we show that this metric has a linear relation with logic utilization and power. We suggest evaluating the trade-off of accuracy vs. complexity (BOPs). The proposed method, when evaluated on ResNet18/34/50 and MobileNet on ImageNet, outperforms the prior state of the art both in the low-complexity regime and the high accuracy regime. We demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, by implementing our non-uniformly quantized CNN on FPGA.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used by different applications that are executed on a range of computer architectures, from IoT devices to supercomputers. The footprint of these networks is huge as well as their computational and communication needs. In order to ease the pressure on resources, research indicates that in many cases a low precision representation (1-2 bit per parameter) of weights and other parameters can achieve similar accuracy while requiring less resources. Using quantized values enables the use of FPGAs to run NNs, since FPGAs are well fitted to these primitives; e.g., FPGAs provide efficient support for bitwise operations and can work with arbitrary-precision representation of numbers. This paper presents a new streaming architecture for running QNNs on FPGAs. The proposed architecture scales out better than alternatives, allowing us to take advantage of systems with multiple FPGAs. We also included support for skip connections, that are used in state-of-the art NNs, and shown that our architecture allows to add those connections almost for free. All this allowed us to implement an 18-layer ResNet for 224x224 images classification, achieving 57.5\% top-1 accuracy. In addition, we implemented a full-sized quantized AlexNet. In contrast to previous works, we use 2-bit activations instead of 1-bit ones, which improves AlexNet's top-1 accuracy from 41.8\% to 51.03\% for the ImageNet classification. Both AlexNet and ResNet can handle 1000-class real-time classification on an FPGA. Our implementation of ResNet-18 consumes 5x less power and is 4x slower for ImageNet, when compared to the same NN on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Smaller NNs, that fit a single FPGA, are running faster then on GPUs on small (32x32) inputs, while consuming up to 20x less energy and power.},
