I'm a Physics Ph.D. student in Technion, advised by [Netanel Lindner](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/lindner/). You can find more details about my experience in [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf). 

**Research interests**: I'm interested in condensed matter theory and, in particular, topological phases as well as application of deep learning and self-supervised learning in physics. 
Currently I focus on edge modes and interfaces in topological state, e.g., Kitaev spin liquid, fractional quantum Hall, p+ip superconductors. 
I also have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/j_links) where I post links to research I find interesting.

**Previously**: 
I finished CS M.Sc. in Technion, advised by [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il/), Avi Mendelson, and [Chaim Baskin](https://chaimb.cs.technion.ac.il/), and studied reduced supervision in computer vision (in particular, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning). I was a research intern in Creative Vision team in Snap Research in Summer 2020, working on 3D reconstruction trained on single 2D views with [Olly Woodford](https://ojwoodford.github.io/) and [Sergey Tulyakov](http://www.stulyakov.com/). 
Before that, I was part of [Rothschild Technion Program for Excellence](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/) and received double B.Sc. (CS and Physics+Math, Cum Laude) from Technion. In 2017, I participated in Google Summer of Code under OpenCV organization.
