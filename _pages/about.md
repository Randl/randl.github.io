I'm a Physics Ph.D. student in Technion, 
advised by [Netanel Lindner](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/lindner/) 
and supported by [Adams fellowship](https://adams.academy.ac.il/). 
You can find more details about my experience in short [resume](/assets/pdf/resume_zheltonozhskii.pdf) or longer academic [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_zheltonozhskii.pdf). 

**Research interests**: 
I'm interested in the condensed matter theory of strongly correlated materials and, in particular, 
topological phases and topological quantum computing, as well as the application of deep learning 
and self-supervised learning in physics. 
Currently, I focus on different aspects of topological quantum computing implementation. This includes experiments 
related to TQC, such as fractional quantum Hall edges, Kitaev spin liquid, and p+ip superconductors, 
possible realizations of universal quantum computing in topological systems, and usage of 
topological system simulations as quantum error-correction codes.
I also have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/j_links) where I post links to research I find interesting.

**Previously**: 
I finished CS M.Sc. in Technion, advised by [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il/), 
Avi Mendelson, and [Chaim Baskin](https://chaimb.cs.technion.ac.il/), 
and studied reduced supervision in computer vision (in particular, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning). 
I was a research intern in Creative Vision team in Snap Research in Summer 2020, 
working on 3D reconstruction trained on single 2D views with [Olly Woodford](https://ojwoodford.github.io/) 
and [Sergey Tulyakov](http://www.stulyakov.com/). 
Before that, I was part of [Rothschild Technion Program for Excellence](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/en/) and 
received double B.Sc. (CS and Physics+Math, Cum Laude) from Technion. In 2017, I participated in Google Summer of Code 
under OpenCV organization.
