I'm a Physics Ph.D. student in Technion,
advised by [Netanel Lindner](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/lindner/)
and supported by [Adams fellowship](https://adams.academy.ac.il/), expected to graduate in Summer 2026.
You can find more details about my experience in short [resume](/assets/pdf/resume_zheltonozhskii.pdf) or longer academic [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_zheltonozhskii.pdf).

**Research interests**:
I'm interested in the condensed matter theory of strongly correlated materials and, in particular,
topological phases and topological quantum computing, as well as the application of deep learning
and self-supervised learning in physics.
Currently, I focus on different aspects of experimental predictions related to topological properties
of strongly correlated matter. This includes experiments related to TQC, such as fractional quantum Hall states,
Kitaev spin liquid, and p+ip superconductors, possible realizations of universal quantum computing in topological systems,
and quantum simulations of topological systems and their usage as quantum error-correction codes.
I also have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/j_links) where I post links to research I find interesting.

**Previously**:
I finished CS M.Sc. (Cum Laude) in Technion, advised by [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il/),
Avi Mendelson, and [Chaim Baskin](https://chaimbaskin.bgu.ac.il/),
and studied reduced supervision in computer vision (in particular, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning).
I was a research intern in Creative Vision team in Snap Research in Summer 2020,
working on 3D reconstruction trained on single 2D views with [Olly Woodford](https://ojwoodford.github.io/)
and [Sergey Tulyakov](http://www.stulyakov.com/).
Before that, I was part of [Rothschild Technion Program for Excellence](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/en/) and
received double B.Sc. (CS and Physics+Math, Cum Laude) from Technion. In 2017, I participated in Google Summer of Code
under OpenCV organization.
